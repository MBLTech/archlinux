# Kwin Rules
My window rules for KDE windwo manager KWIN. These rules include mainly two modifications.
-Forcing Applications to open in a specific Workspace.
-Opening applications without Window border and Frame
Each rule is specifically applied on each application separately, though there is way to apply 2nd rule globally but that wasn't working accurately for me.
