# Kwin Rules:

My window rules for KDE window manager KWIN. These rules include mainly two modifications.
- Forcing Applications to open in a specific Workspace.
- Opening applications without Window border and Frame.
Each rule is specifically applied on each application separately, though there is way to apply 2nd rule globally but that wasn't working accurately for me.

## Note: Added a global rule for Borderess Window frame as well.

# KDE Custom KeyBoard Shorcuts:
Added handful of custom shorcuts as well as have some default ones as well.
